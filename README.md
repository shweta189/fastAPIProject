## Car Price Prediction APP 
The project's goal was for me to get used to and get hands-on experience with the FastAPI framework.

The project is a **Machine Learning - Powered API** built using FastAPI to predict the selling price of a used car based on its characteristics.

### Project Features

* 🔐 Authentication: JWT-based token auth and API key validation
* 🧠 ML Model Prediction: Trained model predicts used car prices
* ⚡ Redis Caching: Avoid redundant model computation
* 📈 Monitoring Ready: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
* 🐳 Dockerized Setup: Simplified deployment with Docker Compose
* ☁️ Cloud Deployment: Easily deploy to Render
